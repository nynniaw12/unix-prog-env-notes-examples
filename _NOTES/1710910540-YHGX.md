# ch4

## regex

^ - beginning of line
$ - end of line
. - single char
\[\] - group
\[^\] - inverted group
\* - closure

## sort

-f - case insensitive
-n - numerical
-r - reverse (-v for grep)
\+m - sorts by skipping m fields
-u - unique

example:
sort +0f +0 -u filenames 
- +0f sorts the line
- +0 sorts the equal lines
- -u extracts unique ones

## uniq

inspiration for -u flag.

-d - prints only duplicates
-c - counts occurences of each line and adds it to the beginning of word in its output

## comm

file comparison

-1 2 3 - suppresses cols 1 2 3 respectively
col 1 is only f1 lines col 2 only f2 col3 both

## tr

transliterates, most common use is converting upper-lower or vice versa

example:
tr a-z A-Z
tr A-Z a-z

## dd

ASCII to EBCDIC and vice versa

## compound example of filters

cat $* | 
tr -sc A-Za-z '\012' | 
sort | 
uniq -c | 
sort -n | 
tail 

prints 10 most commonly used words in a file(s)

## sed

similar syntax to vim editing s/old/new

example of filtering who to get names and dates:
    
who | sed 's/ .*  / /' 

example of indenting each line by a couple of spaces:

sed 's/^/   /' filename $*

example 2 of indenting each line by a couple of spaces this selects non empty lines first:

sed '/./s/^/   /' filename $*

3q prints three lines and quit

-f - read commands from a file

sed '/pattern/q' to print up to and including the pattern and quit
sed '/pattern/d' to delete every line that contains the pattern

-n - turn off auto printing

sed -n '/pattern/!p' invert pattern and print

composite shell example of sed printing files newer than a given one:

ls -t | sed '/^'$1'$/q'

older:

ls -tr | sed '/^'$1'$/q'

## awk

awk '/regex/ { print }' filenames

prints every line matching regex

awk splits each input line automatically into fields

s.t. we can:

who | awk '{ print $1, $5 }'

to print only username and times of last login

-F - changes seperator from blanks to a new one

-f - can input files of cmd to awk

awk '{ print NR, $0}'

NR is number of current input line

use printf for different formats

awk ' { printf "%4d %s\n", NR, $0 } '

$0 is the entire line

example to look for people with no passwords:

awk -F: '$2 == ""' /etc/password

NF - number of fields in a line

length($0) - of a line

BEGIN - keyword to execute before beginning

example:

awk 'BEGIN { FS = ':'}
    $2 == ""' /etc/password

changing FS is same as -F:

END - keyword to execute after finishing

example:

awk 'END { print NR }'

prints number of lines of input

example count lines words and chars

{ nc += length($0) + 1 
  nw += NF }
END {print NR, nw, nc}

vars are initialized to 0 or what you give

split(s, arr, sep)

example of splitting date:

echo 9/29/83 | awk '{split($0, date,"/"); print date\[3\]}'

arrays are associative so anything can be used as index

so can count word frequency and sort

strings are concatanated when they are adjacent
